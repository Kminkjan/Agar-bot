# agario-client
Node.js client for [agar.io](http://agar.io) with API.
This is my first GitHub project so i may did lots of stuff wrong. Also my English is bad.

## Instructions ##
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install client using `npm install agario-client` (ignore `python` errors)
- Run `node ./node_modules/agario-client/example.js` (for testing purpose)
- If it works, you're ready to look at API and code

# API #
There are two types of object that have API:

- **Client** - thing that connects to [agar.io](http://agar.io) server and talks to it. If you want to spawn and control your `Ball`, you need to talk with `Client`
- **Ball** - thing that `Client` creates. Everything in game is `Balls` (viruses/food/players...). You can't control `Balls` objects, only observe what they do.

Both objects have same methods for events from [events.EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html):

- `.on('eventName', callback)` attach listener to event
- `.once('eventName', callback)` attach listener to event but execute only once
- `.removeListener('eventName', callback)` remove listener from event
- `.removeAllListeners('eventName')` remove all listeners from event
- `.emit('eventName', p1, p2...)` emit your own event
- check more in [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html)

# Client API #
    var AgarioClient = require('agario-client');
    var client = new AgarioClient(client_name); 
*client_name* is string for client that will be used for logging (if you enable it). It's not your ball name.

## Client properties ##
Properties that you can change:

- `client.debug` debug level. 0-5. 0 is completely silent. 5 is super verbose. **Default: 1**
- `client.server` address that was used in `client.connect()` call
- `client.inactive_destroy` time in ms for how long ball will live in memory after his last known action (if player exit from game or ball eaten outside our field of view, we will not know it since server sends action only about field that you see. Original code `destroy()` `Ball` when he `disappear` from field of view. You can do that in `client.on('ballDisppear')` if you want it for some reason). **Default: 5\*60\*1000** (5 minutes)
- `client.inactive_check` time in ms for time interval that search and destroy inactive `Balls`. **Default: 10\*1000** (10 seconds)

Properties that better not to change or you can break something:

- `client.balls` object with all `Balls` that `client` knows about. Access `Ball` like `client.balls[ball_id]`
- `client.my_balls` array of alive `Ball`'s IDs that `client` owns and can control.
- `client.score` personal score since respawn
- `client.leaders` array of leader's `Balls` IDs in FFA mode. (player can have lots of `Balls`, but sever sends only one ID of one `Ball`)
- `client.teams_scores` array of team's scores in teams mode
- `client.client_name` name that you have set for `client` (not nickname)
- `client.tick_counter` number of *tick* packets received (i call them ticks because they contains information about eating/movement/size/appear... of `Balls`)

## Client methods ##
- `client.connect(server)` connect to [agar.io](http://agar.io) server. You can get server address by looking in web browser's console while selecting region. You can call it again after `client` disconnected from server. **Example:** `client.connect('ws://1.2.3.4:443')` **ProTip:** each server have few rooms, so you may need reconnect few times before you will get in room that you want. You can look `client.once('leaderBoardUpdate')` to know if you're connected to correct room
- `client.disconnect()` disconnect from server
- `client.spawn(name)` this will spawn `Ball` with nickname. `client.on('myNewBall')` will be called when server sends our `Ball` info
- `client.moveTo(x,y)` send move command. `x` and `y` is 64bit float numbers where you want to move. Coordinates (size) of map you can get in `client.on('mapSizeLoad')`. Your `Balls` will move to coordinates you specified until you send new coordinates to move. Original source code do this every **100ms** (10 times in second) and before split and eject
- `client.split()` will split your `Balls` in two. `Ball` will be ejected in last direction that you sent with `client.moveTo()`. `client.on('myNewBall')` will be called when server sends our `Balls` info
- `client.eject()` will eject some mass from your `Balls`. Mass will be ejected in last direction that you sent with `client.moveTo()`. Ejected mass is `Ball` too (but we don't own them). So `client.on('ballAppear')` will be called when server sends ejected mass `Balls` info.

## Client events ##
In this list `on.eventName(param1, param2)` means you need to do `client.on('eventName', function(param1, param2) { ... })`

- `on.connecting()` connecting to server
- `on.connected()` connected to server
- `on.connectionError(err)` connection error
- `on.disconnect()` disconnected
- `on.message(packet)` new packet received from server (check `packet.js`)
- `on.myNewBall(ball_id)` my new `Ball` created (spawn/split/explode...)
- `on.somebodyAteSomething(eater_id, eaten_id)` somebody ate something
- `on.scoreUpdate(old_score, new_score)` personal score updated
- `on.leaderBoardUpdate(old_array, new_array)` leaders update in FFA mode. Array of leader's `Ball`'s IDs (one ID per leader)
- `on.teamsScoresUpdate(old_scores, new_scores)` array of teams scores update in teams mode
- `on.mapSizeLoad(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)` map size update (after connect)
- `on.reset()` when we delete all `Balls` and stop timers (connection lost?)

- `on.ballRename(ball_id, old_name, new_name)` `Ball` set name/change name/we discover name
- `on.ballUpdate(ball_id, old_update_time, new_update_time)` new data about ball received

# Ball API #
`var ball = client.balls[ball_id];` *ball_id* is number that you can get from events

## Ball properties ##
Properties that you can change:

- None. But you can create properties that don't exists for your needs if you want

Properties that better not to change or you can break something:

- `ball.id` ID of `Ball` (number)
- `ball.name` nickname of player that own the `Ball`
- `ball.x` last known X coordinate of `Ball` (if `ball.visible` is `true` then its current coordinate)
- `ball.y` last known Y coordinate of `Ball` (if `ball.visible` is `true` then its current coordinate)
- `ball.size` last known size of `Ball` (if `ball.visible` is `true` then its current size)
- `ball.color` string with color of `Ball`
- `ball.virus` if `true` then ball is a virus (green thing that explode big balls)
- `ball.mine` if `true` then we do own this `Ball`
- `ball.client` `Client` that knows this `Ball` (if not `ball.destroyed`)
- `ball.destroyed` if `true` then this `Ball` no more exists, forget about it
- `ball.visible` if `true` then we see this `Ball` on our "screen" (field of view)
- `ball.last_update` timestamp when we last saw this `Ball`
- `ball.update_tick` last tick when we saw this `Ball`

## Ball methods ##
- `ball.toString()` will return `ball.id` and `(ball.name)` if set. So you can log `ball` directly
- Other methods is for internal use

## Ball events ##
In this list `on.eventName(param1, param2)` means you need to do `ball.on('eventName', function(param1, param2) { ... })`

 - `on.destroy(reason)` `Ball` deleted (check reasons at the bottom of this document)
 - `on.move(old_x, old_y, new_x, new_y)` `Ball` move
 - `on.resize(old_size, new_size)` `Ball` resize
 - `on.update(old_time, new_time)` new data about `Ball` received
 - `on.rename(old_name, new_name)` `Ball` change/set name/we discover name
 - `on.appear()` `Ball` appear on "screen" (field of view)
 - `on.disappear()` `Ball` disappear from "screen" (field of view)

## agario-devtools ##
If you want record/repeat or watch in real time what your client doing through web browser, you might want to check [agario-devtools](https://github.com/pulviscriptor/agario-devtools)

## Ball destroy reasons list ##
- `{'reason': 'reset'}` when `client` destroys everything (connection lost?)
- `{'reason': 'inactive'}` when we didn't saw `Ball` for `client.inactive_destroy` ms
- `{'reason': 'eaten', 'by': ball_id}` when `Ball` got eaten
- `{'reason': 'merge'}` when our `Ball` merges with our other `Ball`
